Step #1: Determining Data Structure
###################################

The first step is to determine the data structure for the device's interfaces.

In order to do so, we will use postman to connect to the device and obtain information about the interfaces.


Create a CSV file with the information that we want to read, use following as example:

.. csv-table::
   :file: ./reference/Interfaces.csv
   :width: 80%
   :header-rows: 1


Sub-Title
