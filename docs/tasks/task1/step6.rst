Step 6: Using Docker Compose
############################

Docker provides utilities to simplify things with the use of Docker compose.
With Docker compose, we define a YAML file with all the instructions to launch our application and execute just as single command to run the application.

Lets create a docker-compose.yml file with the instructions on how to run our application:

.. literalinclude:: reference/docker-compose.yaml
   :language: YAML

Place this file in the root of your repository.

Lets now start our container with docker-compose using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker-compose up

.. code-block::

   ‚ùØ docker-compose up
   Starting cl_app_1 ... done
   Attaching to cl_app_1
   app_1  | Watching for file changes with StatReloader
