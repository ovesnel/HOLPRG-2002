Step 2: Use IDE
###############

For this session we recommend to use Visual Studio Code (VSC) which is installed in your POD, to open your repo ``HOLPRG-2002`` in VSC follow the instructions:

1- From your terminal within repo directory ``HOLPRG-2002`` run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    code .

.. image:: images/vsc.png
    :width: 75%
    :align: center


Once you have opened VSC, we recommend using the terminal integrated within VSC to open it, do a click in icons as shown on the following screenshot.

.. image:: images/vsc-terminal.png
    :width: 75%
    :align: center

You can use VSC's integrated terminal instead of an external terminal.
