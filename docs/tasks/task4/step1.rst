Step 1: Add Static Files for Cisco UI Kit
#########################################

Copy the directory named :guilabel:`static/` at the root of the repository to your :guilabel:`~/HOLPRG-2002/netprog/` directory.
When copied, the directory should look like the output of the below command:

.. code-block:: bash

    root@ec8da46bb441:/app# ls -la
    total 8
    drwxr-xr-x  7 root root  224 Mar 18 17:56 .
    drwxr-xr-x  1 root root 4096 Mar 18 17:51 ..
    -rw-r--r--  1 root root    0 Mar 18 15:12 db.sqlite3
    drwxr-xr-x 12 root root  384 Mar 18 17:43 interfaces
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  663 Mar 18 17:33 manage.py
    drwxr-xr-x  8 root root  256 Mar 18 17:36 netprog
    drwxr-xr-x  6 root root  192 Mar 18 17:56 static

.. tip::

    Aside from the HTML generated by the server, web applications generally need to serve additional files — such as images, JavaScript, or CSS — necessary to render the complete web page.
    In Django, we refer to these files as "static files" and they are stored in the :guilabel:`static/` directory.
    We have created the directory :guilabel:`~/HOLPRG-2002/static/` with the proper structure that includes all the necessary files to apply the `Cisco UI <https://developer.cisco.com/site/uiux/>`__ customizations.
    You will need to copy this directory to your Django project.
